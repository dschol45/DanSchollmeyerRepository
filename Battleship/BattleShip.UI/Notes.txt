project started, won lottery
taking over but not changing or adding any code in bll

may add more tests, even testing bll. no changes to bll

	may be able to reuse code from blackjack (i/o for numbers and such)

// look at the various objects. board is where a lot of the coding happes for the game
	  ignore private methods, not going to use them

will for many methods want to make an intstance of the classes

will need a board for each player

shouldnt need to create a ship, but may need to reference the enum list of the ship type

for the coordinates, will not use the class but other things do call this code.
	need to collect numbers from user before you call coords

start of actual game needs placeshiprequest object
	collect data from user first

// code example for setting up a ship placement (look at test set up for different set up syntax)

PlaceShipRequest request = new PlaceShipRequest()
request.Direction = ShipDirection.Up;
request.ShipType = ShipType.Destroyer;
request.Coordinate = new Coordinate(15,10);	//invalid, intended to fail on test

ShipPlacement response = new ShipPlacement;
alt options:

ShipPlacement response2 = board.PlaceShip(request); (if using this you dont need to do = new... above)
\\


check coordinate mehtod will help keep track of shothistory for us to use
//
declare variable; call method to store in variable; return variable;;

return Method(params);;
\\

start game
get names
from each player, do 5 ship placements (multi step, review placeshiprequet object)
check coord and loop if invalid

gotcha: user will enter as a letter and a number, convert to numbers for coords
