start game
get names
from each player, do 5 ship placements (multi step, review placeshiprequet object)
check coord and loop if invalid

-- in main, set up and run workflow

//loop to do name and ship placement together for player 1 and then go to 2
//create splashscreen
//create 2 players, make loop for names input
	//instantiate boards for each player (letters are y coor, x is numbers)
//randomizer for GoesFirst (rock paper scissors)
//ship placement for goesfirst and then other (do not have to display to user (can if desired))
	// ask for ship type (display options, ? take out of list for used?, or maybe trap in loop)
	// coord input (A1) (letters to be parsed) ((set up enum?? or switch)) parse substring?
	// ask for direction from coord
	// check if placement valid
		//error on ship type placed already and coord (do/while)
	//repeat for player2, console.clear at end of placement method

//prompt to start turn (no board display atm)
//display opponents board(yellow M for miss, red H for hit)(change on sunk ship?))
//player1 shot1 (call coordMethod and check shot location validity
	//if valid check shot result, pass into opponent's board shot method
	//record and output result
	//check for victory
	//End Turn? readkey(press turn to end turn)
	//clear

//leave clear for asking to start p2 turn
//repeat for player 2, rotate

//11 by 11 array to have a line for a-j and 1-10
